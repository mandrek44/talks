# "From Zero to Hero - Business Increment in 25 minutes"

You'll find slides from presentation "From Zero To Hero ..." in this repo. Slides are rather useless, because 95% of presentation consists of life coding.

More interesting materials are:
 - [Recording from FDD conference (Polish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zev3_2zwwtM)
 - [Source code created during session](https://github.com/mandrek44/notices-kata)
